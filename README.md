## 3D object Detection Techniques

- [Det3D](https://github.com/poodarchu/Det3D) : the first 3D Object Detection toolbox which provides off the box implementations of many 3D object detection algorithms

- **[Focus on]**[OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet): OpenPCDet is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection.
    - [Installation] https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md
    - [Usage] https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md

## Test Dataset

### [`KITTI`](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) (see more [tools](./tools) used in this project)

## 3D Point Cloud Labeling Tools

There are many tools that can provide the function of marking and labeling a bunch of points.
However, most of them are not free or mainly constructed for **LiDAR** data.
